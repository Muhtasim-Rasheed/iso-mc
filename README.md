# Isometric Minecraft!
This is a """game""" that I made in Rust using [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/). It's a [[BADLY OPTIMIZED]] game that looks like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) but in an isometric view.

You can't really place or break blocks though... but you can move around and look at the 128x64x128 world!

# Controls
- WASD to move around
- Thats it really
